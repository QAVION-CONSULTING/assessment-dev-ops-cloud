# Assessment for DevOps and Cloud

## Objective

You are asked to design a small production-ready service that could realistically run in a company environment.

Build a containerized backend system exposed via a reverse proxy, with CI/CD and a documented cloud deployment approach.

Please work in a separate branch and commit all relevant changes in a clear and traceable manner.

## Requirements

### Backend Service
- Create a small REST API (language/framework of your choice):
- GET /health
- One endpoint that reads/writes to a database

### Production Ready Dockerfile
- Provide a Dockerfile demonstrating your skills

### Docker Compose Architecture
- Create a docker-compose.yml containing:
  - Backend
  - Database
  - Reverse proxy 

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Create pipeline to demonstrating your skills

### Cloud Deployment Design (written)
- Write a deployment guide describing how this runs in production.
- Cloud provider choice
- Architecture diagram 
- Compute strategy 
- Networking design 
- Secrets management
- Observability approach
- Scaling strategy
- Rollout strategy
- Disaster recovery considerations
- Cost awareness
  
## Time Frame

Please do not spend more than 6 hours on the implementation. Anything that cannot be implemented within this time frame may be documented in NEXT_STEPS.md, including a short description of how you would approach it.
